# Simon Game 🎮

A browser-based version of the classic **Simon Game**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery**.

## 📝 Description
The Simon Game tests your memory skills by playing a sequence of colours and sounds that you must repeat in the same order.  
Each round, the sequence gets longer, and the challenge increases.

This project is great for:
- Practicing **DOM manipulation** with jQuery
- Working with **arrays** and **event listeners**
- Implementing simple **game logic** in JavaScript
